**Regularization**

**Q1**

You are training a classification model with logistic regression. Which of the following statements are true? Check all that apply.
- [x] Adding many new features to the model makes it more likely to overfit the training set.
- [ ] Adding a new feature to the model always results in equal or better performance on examples not in the training set.
- [ ] Introducing regularization to the model always results in equal or better performance on examples not in the training set.
- [ ] Introducing regularization to the model always results in equal or better performance on the training set.
- [x] Adding a new feature to the model always results in equal or better performance on the training set.

**Q3**

Which of the following statements about regularization are true? Check all that apply.???
- [x] Consider a classification problem. Adding regularization may cause your classifier to incorrectly classify some training examples (which it had correctly classified when not using regularization, i.e. when 0λ=0).
- [ ] Using too large a value of λ can cause your hypothesis to overfit the data; this can be avoided by reducing λ.
- [ ] Using a very large value of λ cannot hurt the performance of your hypothesis; the only reason we do not set λ to be too large is to avoid numerical problems.
- [ ] Because logistic regression outputs values 0≤hθ(x)≤1, its range of output values can only be "shrunk" slightly by regularization anyway, so regularization is generally not helpful for it.
- [x] Using too large a value of λ can cause your hypothesis to underfit the data.
